# avian-flight-visualizer
Build a Python application that ingests and visualizes animal movement data (e.g., Motus detections, ARGOS tracks, GPS fixes, and barometric pressure readings) to explore flight behavior, altitude trends, and receiver coverage. The tool could help researchers identify migratory corridors, altitude preferences, and gaps in receiver networks.
